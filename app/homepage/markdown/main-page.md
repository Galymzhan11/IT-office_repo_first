The source files for this website can be found in [GitHub](https://github.com/karmus89/homepage-django) for anyone interested. The website is a Python [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) project. The styling has been done with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Seleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com/) as the responsive framework. The site is self-hosted, meaning it runs on my own Raspberry Pi. The site also makes use of LinkedIn Developer API for retrieving profile data automatically.
